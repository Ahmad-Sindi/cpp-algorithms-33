Algorithm Challenge #33 – Grade Evaluation System in C++
-
🧮 Problem Overview
-
This challenge focuses on building a grade evaluation system in C++.
The program reads a numeric grade from the user, validates that it falls within the range of 1 to 100, and then assigns a corresponding letter grade based on standard academic criteria.

This exercise strengthens essential programming skills such as input handling, validation, and structured decision-making.

🧠 Grading Criteria
-
The program classifies grades as follows:

A → 90–100

B → 80–89

C → 70–79

D → 60–69

Fail → Below 60

These conditions are implemented using a clean and ordered if–else if–else structure to ensure logical accuracy and avoid overlapping ranges.

💡 Key Concepts Covered
-
Input Validation: Ensuring the user enters a valid grade using a while loop.

Conditional Logic: Applying multiple branching conditions to categorize results.

User-Friendly Error Handling: Prompting for re-entry when input is invalid.

Maintainable Code Structure: Clear, readable, and easy to extend if grading rules change.

🧩 Example
-
Input:
Enter your grade: 92

Output:
Grade: A

📂 File Information
-
Language: C++

File Name: grade_classification.cpp

Challenge Number: #33

💬 Notes
-
This challenge is a practical introduction to real-world validation and decision-making logic.
It demonstrates how simple conditions can form the backbone of reliable user-interactive applications.
Perfect for beginners building a foundation in control structures and program flow.
